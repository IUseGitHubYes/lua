And I don't know where to go, and I swear I'm so alone
You were lying on the phone, and I was crying all night long
Reminiscing  on the times when we were walking in the snow
I was bleeding from my heart, you were playing with my soul
And I know I'm $$$$$ng smart, but you take me as a fool
Can you tell the two apart? Do you even think I'm cool?
Uh
And I don't know where to go, and I swear I'm so alone
You were lying on the phone, and I was crying all night long
Reminiscing on the times when we were walking in the snow
...
And I don't know where to go, and I swear I'm so alone
You were lying on the phone, and I was crying all night long
Reminiscing  on the times when we were walking in the snow
I was bleeding from my heart, you were playing with my soul
And I know I'm $$$$$ng smart, but you take me as a fool
Can  you tell the two apart? Do you even think I'm cool?
I just saw you at my show, remember seeing you at school
You were crying in the hallway, he was such a $$$$$ng tool

Are we feeling happy? Never, you can hold my hand forever
And I know it doesn't help, but I'll buy you a Gucci sweater
We can hang after the party, you can call my phone whenever
Just know that I %%%%%ng got you, I just wanna make it better
I just feel so %%%%%ng fragile, you should handle me with care
And I'm going %%%%%ng crazy, wanna pull out all hair
Everyone's so %%%%%ng lazy, and it looks like no one cares
I've been telling you to wake up, you just give me blank stares

And I don't know what you want
But you won't stop calling my phone
And I just wanna pour champagne
And I just wanna drown my pain
And I don't know what you want
But you won't stop calling my phone
And I just wanna pour champagne
And I just wanna drown my pain
I think I still miss you
I think I still miss you
I think I still miss you

Every day we're %%%%%ng dying, no one's even %%%%%ng trying
Every night I'm %%%%%ng crying, and you're not even replying
I just wanna end it all tonight
I'll be smoking on a Wood when I die

Are we feeling happy? Never, you can hold my hand forever
And I know it doesn't help, but I'll buy you a Gucci sweater
We can hang after the party, you can call my phone whenever
Just know that I %%%%%ng got you, I just wanna make it better
I just feel so %%%%%ng fragile, you should handle me with care
And I'm going %%%%%ng crazy, wanna pull out all hair
Everyone's so %%%%%ng lazy, and it looks like no one cares
I've been telling you to wake up, you just give me blank stares
